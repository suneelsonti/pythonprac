# loops as name suggests keep executing through multiple iterations until they meet a condition

i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print("*" * i) # String when multiplied with an int will be displayed multiple times if i is 2 we see two asterick.
    i += 1 # as long as the condition is still true the python interpreter will move to the while statement
